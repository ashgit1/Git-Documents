Steps:

1. Download the war file of the jenkins and run on the local tomcat container.
2. Then we need to install the required pugin for our project. In my case github, maven and ant.
3. Go to Manages plugins and install the git plugin. Wait for all the activities to get yellow.
4. Once the git plugins are installed restart the server. [Tomcat]
